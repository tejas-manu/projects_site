## Introduction
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this blog post, we'll cover the basics of React and how to get started with your first React application.

## Setting Up Your Environment
First, you'll need to install Node.js and npm. Then, you can create a new React application using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Components in React
React is all about components. Here's a simple component example:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
