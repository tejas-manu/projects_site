## Overview
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that automates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.

## Features
- Automated data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Model versioning and experiment tracking
- Automated model deployment to production
- A/B testing framework for model evaluation

## Technologies
Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, MLflow, Docker

## Challenges
Balancing model complexity with inference speed for real-time predictions.

## Outcome
Improved prediction accuracy by 15% while maintaining sub-100ms inference times.
